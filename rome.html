				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>I was working on a healthcare project with a heavy behavior change component and decided to change a behavior of my own as an empathy exercise. As a regular smoker who was soon to move in with a girlfriend who hated it, I landed on that.</p>
				<p>We were playing with atmospheric interfaces at the time, and I remembered a little prototype I'd made which was supposed to be a game. I loved the concept of <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/en/" class="faux-link">Forest</a>, the concentration app, and thought on how to adapt it to wider behavior change. I arrived at a simple solution: the object is to build a city by collecting and spending coins, which can be earned in two ways. By logging in, you get coins for the amount of days since you started. You can also reward youself with a coin if you feel like you deserve one. With UI and mechanics in place, it was ready to go for the move in date.</p>

				<h4>Result</h4>
				<p>I had my last cigarette on April 16th, 2017. I believe using Rome helped me get through the first week, by far the most difficult one. Rome become something I could fixate on, like Forest, it was a representation of something I was building. Due to the reward mechanism, the city was slow going in the beginning. Eager to see it grow, I was using it every day and giving myself rewards for getting through tough withdraw periods.</p>
				<p>One or two times I was out with friends who were smoking. I had a tough moment but then visulized the ticking number of days and brushed the temptation aside. After awhile, not smoking wasn't difficult anymore, and I stopped using it. Even so, the ever increasing day count sticks with me.</p>
